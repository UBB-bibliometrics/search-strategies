# Remote sensing

Bestilling: Nansen senter for fjernm√•ling

## Scope

Everything that mentions remote sensing in any capacity/context. Focus on Norwegian research (i.e. publications where a Norwegian address is given as an affiliation). 

Timespan: Publication date = 2012-01-01 to 2022-12-31

## Search string, Web of Science

The following strings are combined together with OR (except from the agencies string). They are then combined with AND with `CU="Norway"` to filter for Norwegian publications. Carried out 11th July 2023. 

Carried out in the Web of Science Core Collection:
- WOS.SCI: 1945 to 2023
- WOS.AHCI: 1975 to 2023
- WOS.ESCI: 2018 to 2023
- WOS.SSCI: 1956 to 2023

Without agencies string: 6027 results (2012-2022) - https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/2acdd66e-e63f-4383-9372-8d76b2d129c4-9728ce92/relevance/1

### Journal search

Included content from journals about remote sensing. This was done via a search for journals including "remote sensing", "earth observation" or "GIS" int he title. Only those where the topic was perceieved to be exclusive were added (i.e. *IEEE Geosciences and Remote Sensing* was not included as geosciences seemed too broad and would result in articles from other fields being added).

### General terms

Issue: "GIS" can be used in other contexts, e.g. genome islands, greenland ice sheet, gas-insulated switchgear. However, it is often used in abstracts without being written out in full so can't rely on the full term. Therefore a second phrase is included here (under).

* Added `PPGIS`- public participation GIS
* Added `"aerial photograph*"`
* Added `"aerial laser scan*"`
* Added `remotely sensed`
* Added `unmanned aerial system*` and `unoccupied aerial vehicle$`
* Added `satellite data`

```py
TS=
(   "remote sensing" OR "remotely sensed" OR "earth observation"
    OR "geographical information system*" OR "geographic information system*" OR "PPGIS"
    OR "airborne laser scan*" OR "aerial laser scan*"
    OR "ground truthing" OR "ground validat*"
    OR "GIScience"
    OR "aerial photograph*"

    OR
    (
        ("satellite$" 
        OR "drone$" OR "unmanned aerial vehicle$" OR "unmanned air vehicle$" OR "unmanned aerial system$" OR "unoccupied aerial vehicle$" OR "UAV" OR "UAVs"
        OR "GIS"
        )
        AND
            ("mapping" OR "mapped" OR "ground measure*" OR "monitor*" OR "sentinel" 
            OR "imaging" OR "image$" OR "imagery"
            OR "optical" OR "radar" OR "sensor$"
            OR "data assimilation" OR "machine learning" OR "kalman filter" OR "EnKF"
            OR "ocean* model*" OR "atmosph* model*"
            )
    )
)
```

Additional terms to be combined with GIS (not covered above or in later phrases):

```py
TS=
(   "GIS"
    AND
        ("satellite$" 
        OR "drone$" OR "unmanned aerial vehicle$" OR "unmanned air vehicle$" OR "unmanned aerial system$" OR "unoccupied aerial vehicle$" OR "UAV" OR "UAVs"
        OR "spatial" OR "geographic*" OR "topograph*" OR "elevation"
        OR "land cover"
        OR "map" OR "maps" OR "mapping" OR "mapped" 
        OR "travel" OR "roads" OR "transport"
        OR "GIS based" OR "GIS approach" OR "GIS method$" OR "GIS tool$" OR "GIS software" OR "GIS database$"
        )
)
```

### Satellite missions

Combined those assumed to be more ambiguous with remote sensing terms. Note that the ambiguous terms are not combined with `"remote sensing" OR "earth observation" OR "geographical information system*" OR "GIS" OR "GIScience"` because there is no point - these will be found by phrase 1 anyway.

* Added `TanDEM-X`
* `("Copernicus" NEAR/5 "service*")` should find e.g. copernicus climate change service, copernicus marine service etc.

### Agencies - currently not included in string

Difficult to include as seems to find a number of physics papers. Have dropped `satellit*"`, `monitor*`, `optical` and `sensor$` from the second phrase to try and help. I actually suspect that those found by this phrase (and this phrase alone, not the others) are not particularly relevant. Thus this phrase is not currently included in the final search strategy.
