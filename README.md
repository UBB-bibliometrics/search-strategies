# Search strategies
A collection of various search strategies for finding research literature, created for bibliometric analyses. These have been developed either by us alone or in cooperation with researchers. The strategies have not necessarily been validated. 

Most use either international literature databases, CRISTIN (the Norwegian database), or a combination.
